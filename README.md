In the world where sharing of well formatted data has become a necessity and Our URL lengths have gotten longer.
That's where Shortnr and Sharebin will come into play as it's obvious by the naming scheme that

- **Shortnr** is going to be useful for making lengthy URLs shorter. 
- **Sharebin** will allow users to share text documents.


## Tech Stack Used :

- ### Backend - C# (.NET)
- ### Database - MsSQL , MongoDB

Note :
I chose MSSQL as a primary database for Smllr and ShareBin because I planned to add User Service and some dashboard like stuff for urls and sharebin docs generated by a user to this web application but because of some time constrains I have not been able to do it yet.
